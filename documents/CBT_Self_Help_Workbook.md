# Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Self-Help Workbook

## Introduction to CBT

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based approach that helps people identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors. This workbook provides practical tools and exercises to support your mental wellness journey.

## Understanding the CBT Model

### The Thought-Feeling-Behavior Triangle

Thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected. When you change one, it affects the others.

```
    THOUGHTS
       /\
      /  \
     /    \
FEELINGS--BEHAVIORS
```

### Common Thinking Patterns (Cognitive Distortions)

1. **All-or-Nothing Thinking**: Seeing things in black and white
   - Example: "I'm either perfect or a complete failure"

2. **Overgeneralization**: Making broad conclusions from single events
   - Example: "I failed this test, so I'm bad at everything"

3. **Mental Filter**: Focusing only on negative aspects
   - Example: Focusing on one criticism while ignoring praise

4. **Discounting the Positive**: Minimizing positive experiences
   - Example: "That compliment doesn't count"

5. **Jumping to Conclusions**: Making assumptions without evidence
   - **Mind Reading**: "They think I'm boring"
   - **Fortune Telling**: "This will definitely go wrong"

6. **Catastrophizing**: Expecting the worst possible outcome
   - Example: "If I don't get this job, my life is ruined"

7. **Emotional Reasoning**: Believing feelings reflect reality
   - Example: "I feel worthless, so I must be worthless"

8. **Should Statements**: Rigid expectations for self and others
   - Example: "I should always be happy"

9. **Labeling**: Defining yourself or others with negative labels
   - Example: "I'm stupid" instead of "I made a mistake"

10. **Personalization**: Taking responsibility for things beyond your control
    - Example: "It's my fault my friend is upset"

## CBT Tools and Techniques

### 1. Thought Records

Use this format to examine your thoughts:

**Situation**: What happened?
**Emotion**: What did you feel? (Rate intensity 1-10)
**Automatic Thought**: What went through your mind?
**Evidence For**: What supports this thought?
**Evidence Against**: What contradicts this thought?
**Balanced Thought**: What's a more realistic thought?
**New Emotion**: How do you feel now? (Rate intensity 1-10)

#### Example Thought Record:
- **Situation**: Friend didn't reply to my text
- **Emotion**: Anxiety (8/10)
- **Automatic Thought**: "They hate me and don't want to be friends"
- **Evidence For**: They usually reply quickly
- **Evidence Against**: They might be busy, phone died, didn't see it
- **Balanced Thought**: "There are many reasons they might not reply immediately"
- **New Emotion**: Anxiety (4/10)

### 2. Behavioral Experiments

Test your thoughts and fears through planned activities:

1. **Identify the Thought**: What belief do you want to test?
2. **Design the Experiment**: What specific action will test this?
3. **Predict the Outcome**: What do you think will happen?
4. **Conduct the Experiment**: Carry out the planned activity
5. **Observe Results**: What actually happened?
6. **Draw Conclusions**: What did you learn?

### 3. Activity Scheduling

Plan pleasant and meaningful activities to improve mood:
