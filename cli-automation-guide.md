## Getting Started Commands

```bash
# Clone the repository (once available)
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mental-wellness-platform
cd mental-wellness-platform

# One-command complete setup (runs overnight)
./scripts/setup-everything.sh --auto-yes

# Or run phases individually
./scripts/run-phase.sh --phase 1 --verbose
# Review outputs, make customizations
./scripts/run-phase.sh --phase 2 --verbose
# Continue through all phases...

# Daily development workflow
./scripts/dev-server.sh          # Start development environment
./scripts/test-changes.sh        # Test your modifications  
./scripts/deploy-local.sh        # Update local deployment
```

**üéØ Bottom Line**: You'll spend most of your time on creative customization and testing, while the CLI handles all the heavy lifting of infrastructure, service creation, and deployment automation!
