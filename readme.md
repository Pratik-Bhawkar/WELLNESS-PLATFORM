## 🔄 Key Architectural Decisions & Adaptations

### Pure Python Architecture Decision
**Why we chose pure Python over multi-language:**
- **Simplified Dependencies**: Single language stack eliminates inter-service complexity
- **Unified Development**: All services use FastAPI with consistent patterns
- **Rapid Deployment**: No Java/C# runtime dependencies or compilation steps
- **Local LLM Focus**: Python ecosystem provides best AI/ML library support
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized environment variables and CORS setup

**Impact**: ✅ 100% service compatibility and simplified deployment pipeline

### Single-Port Architecture Benefits
**Why unified API over multiple services:**
- **Simplified Deployment**: One service to manage instead of three separate processes
- **Reduced Complexity**: Single port eliminates port management and CORS issues
- **Better Performance**: Shared resources and optimized memory usage
- **Easier Scaling**: Single service architecture for future enhancements
- **Cleaner Configuration**: One API endpoint for frontend integration

**Strategy**: Unified API for Phase 2 → Microservices upgrade for Phase 3 if needed

### Direct HTTP vs WebSocket Communication
**Why we chose direct HTTP:**
- **Simplicity**: RESTful endpoints easier to debug and test
- **Browser Compatibility**: No WebSocket connection management complexity
- **Service Independence**: Each service can be developed and tested independently
- **Error Handling**: Better error propagation and retry mechanisms
- **Development Speed**: Faster implementation and debugging cycles

**Strategy**: HTTP for Phase 2 → WebSocket upgrade for real-time features in Phase 3

### Environment Setup: Dynamic PATH Management
**Windows-specific adaptations:**
- **Multi-tool Environment**: Python, Node.js, Java, .NET, Git coordination
- **PATH Persistence**: Dynamic environment variable configuration across PowerShell sessions
- **Virtual Environment**: Isolated Python dependencies preventing conflicts
- **Tool Detection**: Automatic discovery of installed development tools
